# Starlight PHP Bookmarks
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/starlight-php-bookmarks

This was my learning-the-ropes-of PHP project, back when I had close to no experience in programming. It's very basic and not a good representation of my current work, and I'll probably rewrite it one day, to compare. :)

NOTE: I would not recommend using this in any production enviromment! It's buggy and not up to today's security and aesthetic standards, to say the least.
