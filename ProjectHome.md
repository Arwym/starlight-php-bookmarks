# Starlight (PHP) Bookmarks #

## Introduction ##

SBM, or **Starlight (PHP) Bookmarks** is a simple PHP script that allows you to keep and manage a directory of personal links, that you can easily incorporate to your website's design with only a few code snippets.

I started it in 2007 as my first serious PHP project, and is constantly being revised and improved as I become more skilled.  Since that time, and thanks to this project, I've come to understand many things that I didn't before.

The script won't be officially released until it has reached good quality and performance standards.

I have opened this project site so that other, more skilled PHP developers can see the progress of my project and, if interested, give me some advice for improvement.  :)

Thank you for coming!

## News ##

**May 29, 2009**: I've been working some more on the project today, and made several changes and updates to the script.  Also fixed a few bugs.  Still a long way to go, though.  Or so I feel.  I'll start a to-do list.  Feel free to contact me for suggestions to improve the script.  I will need a lot of feedback.

**April 22, 2009**: Project website created!  The source hasn't been uploaded, but I will do that once I've revised it and applied the proper license information, and some pending bug fixes and improvements.
